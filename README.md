PESC EDI College Transcripts

https://www.pesc.org/pesc-approved-standards.html

PESC has developed a EDI transcript. However, a parser is not provided from them to handle these standards. 
I hope that by developing a free parser more schools would attempt to use electronic transcripts. 

If you pass in a file this will parse all the values and return it as an array.
PESC has a lot of standards and codes that are both optional and required I tried to include all of them.
